# Portfolio_v2
A sample of my portfolio, re-done in VueJS

##Why VueJS?
This framework is very light, and allows for a lot of reactive components; all of which I want to stress as I grow in my skill set.

My thinking is this: when learning a framework, build small projects and gradually get bigger.

This is one of my projects.
